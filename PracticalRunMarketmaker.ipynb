    "## 3. Build the `OrderChain`, including instantiating the `Elements` you want to use\n",
    "\n",
    "This merits a bit of explanation. There's a more detailed explanation of what an `OrderChain` is, what `Elements` are available (and what configuration options they provide), in the [documentation](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-explorer/blob/main/docs/MarketmakingOrderChain.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "An `OrderChain` is what builds the `Order`s you want the marketmaker to place - the 'desired' `Order`s. Typically the first `Element` builds a list of `Order`s, and subsequent (optional) `Element`s add, remove or change those orders. After all `Element`s have had the chance to operate on the `Order`s, the list of these 'desired' `Order`s is ready for the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first `Element` could be a `RatiosElement` that builds a BUY and SELL order at a spread of 0.5% and a position size of 5% of inventory. Then the next `Element` could be a `BiasQuoteOnPositionElement` to adjust the price of those `Order`s based on the current 'position':\n",
    "- if the position is net-short, it would adjust the price down to tend to buy more, or\n",
    "- if the position is net-long, it would adjust the price up to tend to sell more\n",
    "\n",
    "The final element could then round the price and quantity values to the proper 'lot sizes' for the market. Having this as the last stage means it only needs to be done once, and it makes it easier to compare `Order`s when it comes to 'reconciliation' (see the next step).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the functionality in separate `Element`s makes the system more configurable and much easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code builds that example `OrderChain`, with a `RatiosElement`, a `BiasQuoteOnPositionElement`, and a `RoundToLotSizeElement`.\n",

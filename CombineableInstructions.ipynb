    "# 🥭 Combinable Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to build a series of `CombinableInstructions` and then run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CombinableInstructions` are unique to `mango-explorer` (as far as I know) and they aim to make code efficinet and clear at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CombinalbleInstructions` are often created by a `MarketInstructionBuilder` which is specialised for the particular market type (perp markets need different instructions to spot markets, for example). The `MarketInstructionBuilder` operates at a lower level than the `MarketOperations` in the previous examples, but you may find a combination of both helps. We'll use both here, since `MarketOperations` provides a simple way to display orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are `CombinableInstructions`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mango operations are typically one or more Solana `Instruction`s - zero or more Solana `Instruction`s if the operation was optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instruction`s are batched into Solana `Transaction`s and it's those `Transaction`s that are sent to Solana and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a limit on the size of a Solana `Transaction`. It can't be more than 1232 bytes or it will be rejected. (1232 bytes is the usable space in a UDP frame with an MTU of 1500, so it's a practical infrastructure limitiation not something dreamed up by Solana.)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the `Transaction` keep track of its size and let you know when an `Instruction` approaches or goes over the limit?\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't...\n",
    "\n",
    "So `mango-explorer` wraps `Instruction`s and key signers in a `CombinableInstructions` object, and - to make things even easier - overrides the '+' operation to allow `CombinableInstructions` to be combined. And when `execute()` is called on the `CombinableInstructions`, the actual `Instruction`s are batched (but never re-ordered) so that each `Transaction` is below the maximum size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the `Instruction`s are batched according to the limits, but that is not something the calling code usually needs to bother about. It can just add `CombinableInstructions` together and `execute()` them, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# signers, do_something, do_something_else, and cleanup are all of type CombinableInstructions\n",
    "all_combinable_instructions = signers + do_something + do_something_else + cleanup\n",
    "transaction_ids = all_combinable_instructions.execute(context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signers\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction data has to be signed before being submitted to Solana, and some operations require creation and use of temporary keys for signing. `CombinableInstructions` also carry keys for signing, so any `CombinableInstructions` can carry with them the keys required to execute them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally though, it's assumed that `CombinableInstructions` will be executed in the context of a particular wallet, so the only time additional keys are used is when they are different from the wallet keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Wallet` typically provides the signers for the whole operation via the `mango.CombinableInstructions.from_wallet(wallet)` method. This provides a `CombinableInstructions` object with the `Wallet` signing keys, but no `Instruction`s. It can then be added to other `CombinableInstructions` to allow them to be signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically it is the first in the chain of:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(signers + op1 + op2 + op3).execute(context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Example Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows the orderbook, places the order, shows the orderbook again (which should show our order), then cancels the order and shows the orderbook a final time (which should no longer have our order).\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses `CombinableInstructions` to place an order. It follows the pattern of how the `marketmaker` places orders:\n",
    "* place the `Order`\n",
    "* crank the market\n",
    "* settle the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "It's this place/crank/settle which shows the use of `CombinableInstructions` best. The important bits of the code are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "place_order = market_instructions.build_place_order_instructions(order)\n",
    "crank = market_instructions.build_crank_instructions([])\n",
    "settle = market_instructions.build_settle_instructions()\n",
    "(signers + place_order + crank + settle).execute(context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The rest of this example is putting us in the position to build those instructions, showing what's going on, or cleaning up after."
